<h1>Star DB Challenge: Season 2 Week 2</h1>

<h2>Part 1 (out of 2)</h2>

<p>
    Please head to the Seclusion Zone.
    Assuming Scarakabaz is the center of the polar coordinate plane,
    go to a point satisfying the polar coordinates below:
</p>

<p>
    Radius: <Katex>PlayableChars + TeleportPoints_{"{HertaSpaceStation}"} </Katex> meters
</p>

<p>
    Argument: <Katex>TrailBlazePower_{"{Max}"} + \sqrt[3]{"{TBPReq_{Lv64-65}}"}</Katex> in degrees
</p>



<p>
    You can interact with an entity there, and your password is the 4th word it says to you.
</p>

<p>
    You will be able to validate the radius as well as the argument, but round them to the nearest 5 before you validate.
