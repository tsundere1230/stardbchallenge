<h1>Star DB Challenge: Season 2 Week 2</h1>

<h2>Part 1 (out of 2)</h2>

<p>
    Please head to the Seclusion Zone. Assuming Scarakabaz is the center of the
    polar coordinate plane, go to a point satisfying the polar coordinates
    below:
</p>

<p>
    Radius: {@html math(
        ">PlayableChars + TeleportPoints_{HertaSpaceStation})meters",
    )}
</p>

<p>
    Argument: {@html math(">TrailBlazePower_{Max} + sqrt[3]{TBPReq_{Lv64-65}}")}
    in degrees
</p>

<p>
    You can interact with an entity there, and your password is the 4th word it
    says to you.
</p>

<p>
    You will be able to validate the radius as well as the argument, but round
    them to the nearest 5 before you validate.
</p>
