<h1>Star DB Challenge Season 2 Week 2</h1>

<h2>Julius question</h2>
<h4>
    (This is a challenge from Julius and has nothing to do with anything before
    :) )<br /><br />
</h4>

<h4>Selfcontained</h4>

<p>
    Everyone: Select very peculiar words.
    <br />
    Avoid overreaching lines, that's inattentive...
    <br />
    Each line, an index hides gracefully, weightlessly.
    <br />
    Initially, humbly follow the instructions, subsequently unfastening.
</p>
