<h1>Star DB Challenge Season 2 Week 2</h1>

<h2>Part 2/3</h2>

<p>
    Please now leave the Seclusion Zone go to a map that fulfills the following
    conditions:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There exist three (almost) co-linear SPACE ANCHORS [this is "The Line"].
    </li>
    <li>The space anchors must be on the same floor of the map.</li>
    <li>
        On the map, there is EXACTLY one point of interest that you can click
        'Navigate' on. This does not have to be on "The Line".
    </li>
    <li>
        The exit markers that would allow you to be sent to a different area
        does not count as a point of interest.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Your task is now to measure the distance between the two teleport points on
    the ends of The Line.
</p>

<p>
    Your password is {@html math("Length_{Line}")} in feet (round it to an integer).
</p>

<p>
    There is no validation for this question :sobpuddle: (but there is a small
    range of values accepted).
