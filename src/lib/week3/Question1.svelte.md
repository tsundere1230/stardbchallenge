# Happy Lunar New Year! Challenge 1/5

To the StarDB Chivellengers,

I wish upon you all a Happy Lunar New Year 🧧! With the upcoming festivities, comes celebration! 🎉 The Moon Bunny Council 🌙🐇 shall be hosting these upcoming week’s challenges!

For those who are unsure about what this celebration entails, below is a tale to introduce you to this holiday!

_Over 3,500 Amber Eras ago, in the Xianzhou, reigned Emperor Shang. At the end of the year, it was customary to pay blessings to Lan of the Hunt 🐏, Long of the Permanence 🐉, and for those involved in the dark arts… It was not uncommon to see followers of Yaoshi of the Abundance 🐈‍ paying tribute by burning bamboo. But across the vast galaxy many of the other Aeons were also celebrated. With a total of 12 of them holding a pillar in the official Zodiac, Yaoshi being shunned and not part of the original roster, making them an unofficial 13th member, who shares the same “spot” as Aha the Elation 🐇, who believed this trickery would serve as a fantastical addition into their script. This upcoming year we celebrate the year of the Wood Dragon!_

**To join into the festivities, please reply to this invitation with the correct answer:**

$\frac{The Year Of The Most Recent 💧 🐀}{(The Next 🔥 🐍 Year) + (The Next 🌎 Year After The Next 🌎 🐓)}$ x [Upcoming 🤘🐕] + [The 🐅 Position] + 1000

**Ignore decimals. What is the resulting year? [Element + Animal + Year]**
