# Geo-catching Challenge 3/5

You look at the entrance ticket and realize… it’s just another puzzle! Security is so tight this year round…

_At the origin of a **C**hild’s Letter lies the first p**o**i**n**t
Followed by Arterm’s rescue by an u**n**known man
Fr**e**t not, Bel will walk you through everything
With a poem on how people from all **c**orners of the world s**t**umbled
Into the quarrel between Your truest friend, Sonya._

Once I return to the origin, I will complete what I’m seeking…

What a bunch of nonsense! What are they looking for?
