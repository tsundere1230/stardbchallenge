So the way to determine good/bad language: since EN has the letter "H", it can't possibly be removed from Syllogistic Paradox, and neither can the 'm' in CN. So JP/KR are the bad languages.

We are left with [Sylotic x] as the leftover letters when you remove the JP/KR letters.

We now need to add [leiaamotpH] back to [Sylotic x]. From Black Swan hint you know that [oaail] have been
deleted and added again, so if you deleted a's from Paradox, you will add them to Sylotic(aa).

Hence we have [Syloticaao lix] + Hptem.

We know the 2nd word is at most 5 letters long, and H is capitalised, incentivising us to go for [Helix].

Using HSR wiki we can unscramble the first word to be Somatotypical.
