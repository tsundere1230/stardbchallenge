09: Silverwolf JP Ult
10: Pela EN Ult
11: Jingliu CN Ult
12: Sushang CN Ult
13: Topaz JP Basic
14: Clara JP Skill
15: Jingyuan CN Ult
16: Kafka JP Ult
17: Black Swan CN Ult
18: Trailblazer KR Basic
19: Blade JP Talent
20: Guinaifen EN Ult

So the way to determine good/bad language: since EN has the letter "H", it can't possibly be removed from Syllogistic Paradox, and neither can the 'm' in CN. So JP/KR are the bad languages.

We are left with [Sylotic x] as the leftover letters when you remove the JP/KR letters.

We now need to add [leiaamotpH] back to [Sylotic x]. From Black Swan hint you know that [oaail] have been
deleted and added again, so if you deleted a's from Paradox, you will add them to Sylotic(aa).

Hence we have [Syloticaao lix] + Hptem.

We know the 2nd word is at most 5 letters long, and H is capitalised, incentivising us to go for [Helix].

Using HSR wiki we can unscramble the first word to be Somatotypical.

Which are the greek letter rho and zeta. Since everything was based on translation I was looking
for the translation stone `rosetta`
