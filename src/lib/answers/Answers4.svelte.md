# Q1
There is not much to explain here, but I'll try to go through the logic of how we made as doable as possible.

The overall goal of the puzzle is to find out which letters you need to delete from "Syllogistic Paradox", and find out what letters you have to add to it. The hints state that whether the attack is basic/skill/ult/talent doesn't matter, only "goodspeak" and "badspeak" does. There is also a small hint with "anwsre" that the answer will have to be obtained via an anagram. So this means that firstly we need to find out which languages correspond to letters to add/remove. Anagram solvers can solve anagrams with missing letters (e.g. nutrimatic.org), which is why finding out what letters (the badspeak languages) to REMOVE is way more important.(This is why I decided to give out KR hints for free) From here the guide below assumes you don't speak a single word of CN/JP/KR, but that you can at least differentiate between them (if you can't then this challenge will be a lot more difficult). There will be as little guesswork as possible.

First, I expected that the English lines were the easiest, so: 04Huohuo, 05: Dr Ratio, 10: Pela, 20: Guinafen.
These gave us the letters [i H a l]. Right away we can see that there is no 'H' in "Syllogistic Paradox", which confirms that EN is a goodspeak.

There are a few tracks with additional sound effects taken from the game, such as 11:Jingliu and 13: Topaz. These give us the letters [e l]. Again there is no 'e' in "Syllogistic Paradox", which implies CN is a 'goodspeak'. This also implies JP and KR are the badspeaks.

Next we will have to work with distinct sounds and patterns. I cranked the reverb on 01[d] and 09[s] to the absolute max :doggokek: (without obscuring hearing). When Welt and Silverwolf ult, they have a LOT of reverb on all languages. "Sei to shi" and "kono speedo de" are also relatively easy to search assuming you can discern it is Japanese.

For patterns:
02:Qingque [P] will repeat 'please please please' in all languages.
03:Dan Heng[m] screams 'break' at the top of his lungs at the end in every language.
16:Kafka[a] should be easy enough with the boom :)
In total, this gives us [d s P a] to subtract and [m] to add.

Next the hint that Trailblazer speaks Korean is deliberate; if you are able to discern which voices are Korean (06, 18) it shouldn't be too hard to brute force this one :) You obtain [a], and also with a bit of guess and check you'll find 06:Luocha[o] too.

We have 7 letters left and the additional hint given after obtaining 8 letters was "Of the 6 CN lines, all are characters originally from or living on the Xianzhou, except the only Penacony character in the list." Note that there are only two eligible Penacony characters: Black Swan and Sparkle.

A bit of guess work or searching is needed from here (I consider these last 7 the hard ones).
I have checked that searching "Senmetsu kaishi" on fandom wiki returns 14:Clara[r] (and Arlan...) Searching "Higan" or "Higan sousou" yields 19:Blade[i] You can also try to search the last JP but I found it quite hard; if you search around for inochi(å‘½) hopefully that is a good hint for 08 Ruan Mei[g]... 

Finally the last 4 are quite difficult, even as a CN speaker myself... so yeah... hopefully with some trial and error you get 17:Black Swan[o] first (or if you can recognise my voice and know I'm a Black Swan simp (jk)

The rest is really just down to searching the wiki if you are not a CN speaker, but they are at least down to the Xianzhou characters not on the list...
07:Hanya[t] (imo this is the hardest one, but shoutout to Aza for being a great Hanya :)
12:Sushang[p]
15:Jingyuan[a]

Of course, everything above is made easy if you play on any of CN/KR/JP or speak any of them :)

We are left with [Sylotic x] as the leftovers, and [leiaamotpH] to add.
Now from Black Swan's hint we know the letters [o a a i l] were deleted and added back, so let's place them:
[Syloticaao + lix + metpH]
Since H is capitalised, it's a hint to put it in second, and we know from Ruan Mei's hint that the second word is at most 6 letters long, so hopefully you get [Helix] from it.
Finally attempting to unscramble Syloticaaomtp will give you Somatotypical :)
