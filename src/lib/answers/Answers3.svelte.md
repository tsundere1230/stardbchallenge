# Q3

This was a Geolocation Challenge. Therefore that served as an indication/hint to what you had to look for locations/landmarks. Or at least that was my intention... haha

Each line of the stanza corresponded to a readable within HSR

At the origin of a <u>**C**hild’s Letter</u> lies the first p**o**i**n**t
Followed by <u>Arterm’s rescue by an u**n**known man</u>
Fr**e**t not, <u>Bel will walk you through everything</u>
With a <u>poem on how people from all **c**orners of the world s**t**umbled</u>
Into the quarrel between <u>Your truest friend, Sonya.</u>

All readables are located in Jarilo-VI Administrative District,

- Child's Letter
- Tale of the Winterlands, Chapter 2: Frozen City (Part 1)
- Message for New Repairers
- The Traveler Who Survived the Blizzard
- Densely Packed Schedule

The bolded letters give a hint: **Connect**
The general idea was for you to identify the locations (origins) of each readable and these would serve as landmarks (points). Then, you'd _connect_ each point in the map.
The last line _Once I return to the origin, I will complete what I'm seeking_ is an instruction to connect the 5th point to the 1st, completing the shape of a **Star** which is ultimately the final answer.

# Q4

In the past I've hosted and designed several Crossword puzzles for these challenges. This was a suggestion by someone in the community, to make an unconnected Crossword Puzzle. And I themed it around HSR/Lunar New Year so once people figured out the pattern they'd be able to solve these pretty easily. 16 Horizontal was just a curve ball... Cuz I gotta keep ya'll on your toes.

1. Fire
2. Pig
3. Rat (In my universe, the Ox = Bull Beetle :))
4. Goat
5. Earth
6. Horse
7. Dog
8. Water (Down) / Wood (Across)
9. Snake
10. Metal
11. Dragon
12. Tiger
13. Monkey
14. Rooster
15. Rabbit (Mentioned in Challenge 1)
16. Cat (Down; Mentioned in Challenge 1) / Skaracabaz (He resembles a bull beetle :) Across

# Q5

There is 6 letters, that are contained in each word `einort`. Putting that into the website gives you the hint

`Try replacing these letters with blanks`

Doing that yields

```
sub__d__a__s
f___cas___g
c______lla
p______s
acc______s
d___u___g
```

which is just morse code for `Brains`
