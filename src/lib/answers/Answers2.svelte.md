# Q1

There are $[40]$ or $[41]$ characters, depending if you include Dr. Ratio (but it doesn't matter).<br>
There are $[23]$ teleport points in Herta's Space Station.<br>
Maximum Trailblaze Power is $[240]$.<br>
The EXP requirement to go from Level 64 to 65 is $[26630]$. The cube root of that is approximately $[30]$.<br>
Therefore, the Radius rounds to $65$ and the Angle rounds to $270$.

This translates to the following location marked in red:

![]({seclusionzone})

Interacting with the following robot, and it will say 'Emergency' as the fourth word.

![]({robotq1})

# Q2

"The Line" can be found on Cloudford. This is the only acceptable map for this geolocation puzzle.

The only way to measure distances in game is to attempt to 'navigate' to a place of interest, in this case Maozhen's shop.

![]({maozhenclose})

![]({maozhenfar})

You can do this for the two end points, creating a triangle like this:

![]({cloudfordq2})

Now you can either assume it's a right-angled triangle or use the cosine rule to obtain an answer of approximately $160-170$ meters. Converting to feet and you'll get $540$ ft., and we gave a $\pm15$ ft leeway in both directions.

# Q3

As the instruction tell you, there is an index (number) hidden in each line.
These are (self)contained in a word from each line.

| Word             | Number    | Letter (index within the word) |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Every**one**     | 1 (one)   | e                              |
| inat**ten**tive  | 10 (ten)  | v                              |
| w**eight**lessly | 8 (eight) | e                              |
| unfas**ten**ing  | 10 (ten)  | n                              |

Selecting every even word per line (not overreaching lines):

- select
- peculiar
- overreaching
- that's
- line
- index
- gracefully
- humbly
- the
- subsequently

The starting letters spell SPOTLIGHTS
