# Q1
They are hexagrams from the Yi Jing. They mean (roughly)
"Viewing" "Ground" "Shaking" and "Force", and, well that's a seismograph.

# Q2

1. Rosa from Tears of Themis (yes I know the camera covers half of one guy's face, but he's actually depicted there lol)
2. Coquelic from Path to Nowhere
3. Hanya from ... do I need to say it?
4. Horus from Puzzles and Dragons
5. Kafk- i mean Shalom from Path to Nowhere 
6. Yagi Yui from Mahjong Soul
7. Red Hood from Nikke: Goddess of Victory
8. Hinomori Shizuku from Project Sekai: (insert 16 more words in the title)
9. Wriothesley from Genshin Impact
10. Mashu Kyrielight from Fate Grand Order

Using the nth letter of each name according to its position in the list, you get:
[r] from Rosa, [o] from Coquelic, etc...
you get an anagram for Golden Hour (not Ground Hole...)

# Q3
Letter behind each character is the language, so .e stands for English.
Every character connected by an equals sign share a voice actor in the language, so
Suzie Yeung voices Shalom, Eula, and Makima for example.

The three voice actors in the last line are all voice actors of Firefly (in different languages).

# Q4
The bars in the first row is a number cipher, so you get 15-14-5 15-11 ... which spells "ONE OK ROCK".

The next line has three different albums by One Ok Rock and the 7/7/6th tracks of the respective albums are
"Change" "Crazybotch" and "Bethelight".
You are supposed to read them together as "Change Crazybotch (into) Bethelight".

ROTZACCYBHJP is an anagram of crazybotch + JP; and (apparently) you're supposed to know to replace the first 10 letters 'bethelight', in that order. So something like:

crazybotch
0123456789
bethelight

rotzaccybh
1673271459
eighthbelt + jp

The eighth belt in japanese is 'hachidan' (八段).
