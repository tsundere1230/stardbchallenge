<h1>Star DB Challenge: Season 2 Week 1</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to the Season 2! As I (tsun) am learning the javascript ropes (holy
    I hate javascript), this week's challenge will be a lot simpler :)
</p>

<p>
    Please make sure all your answers are in decimal, without units. Example:
    {@html math("3/8")} is {@html math("0.375")}.
    <br />
    If the answer is a percentage, please give it as a decimal. Example: {@html math(
        "52.5\\%",
    )}
    is {@html math("0.525")}.
    <br />
    Alright, that's all you need to know, good luck!
</p>

<h2>Question 1</h2>

<p>
    We are playing "Honkai: Star Railed" and it is the same game as Honkai: Star
    Rail, but unlike Star Rail, there is NO soft pity. However, you will be
    pleased to find out that {@html math("50 - 50")} exists per normal.
</p>

<p>
    In "Honkai: Star Railed", the probability of pulling a 5-star character is
    {@html math("[AdoptedChildren_{Yukong}]\\%")}. You are pulling on the Ruan
    Mei banner.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        a) Find the probability of obtaining NO 5-star characters in {@html math(
            "[PlayableStellaronHunters_{1.6}]",
        )} pulls.
    </li>
    <li>
        b) Find the probability of obtaining NO Ruan Mei's in {@html math(
            "[PlayableStellaronHunters_{1.6} - 1]",
        )} pulls.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Your password is {@html math("10000Ans(a) - Ans(b)")}.
</p>
