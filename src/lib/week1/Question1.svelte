<h1>Star DB Challenge: Season 2 Week 1</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to the Season 2! As I (tsun) am learning the javascript ropes (holy I hate javascript), 
    this week's challenge will be a lot simpler :)
</p>

<p>
    Please make sure all your answers are in decimal, without units. Example:
    <Katex><b>3/8</b></Katex> is <Katex><b>0.375</b></Katex>. <br/>If the answer is a percentage,
    please give it as a decimal. Example: <Katex><b>52.5\%</b></Katex> is <Katex><b>0.525</b></Katex> . <br/>
    Alright, that's all you need to know, good luck!
</p>

<h2>Question 1</h2>

<p>
    We are playing "Honkai: Star Railed" and it is the same game as Honkai: Star Rail, 
    but unlike Star Rail, there is NO soft pity.
    However, you will be pleased to find out that <Katex>50 - 50</Katex> exists per normal.
</p>

<p>
    In "Honkai: Star Railed", the probability of pulling a 5-star character is 
    <Katex>[AdoptedChildren_{"{Yukong}"}]\%</Katex> . You are pulling on the Ruan Mei banner.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>a) Find the probability of obtaining NO 5-star characters in <Katex>[PlayableStellaronHunters_{"{1.6}"}]</Katex> pulls.</li>
    <li>b) Find the probability of obtaining NO Ruan Mei's in <Katex>[PlayableStellaronHunters_{"{1.6}"} - 1]</Katex> pulls.</li>
</ol>

    Your password is <Katex>10000Ans(a) - Ans(b)</Katex>.
